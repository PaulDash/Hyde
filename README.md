PowerShell static site generator. The ugly Mr. Hyde to the popular Jekyll. Created as a fun project to only generate my own private webpage, but useful as an example when teaching about PowerShell.

## Development status

In three (3) days and nights, I managed to implement much of the configuration loading. There's a lot of it going on from different sources. A lot.

As of this writing, Hyde only copies static files and does NOT process pages or posts.

This code is not usable until I find another 72 hours straight. Or YOU help out!

## Not implemented

- Plugins
- any functionality which requires Plugins
- Sass Converter (duh, it's a Plugin)
- gem-based themes (obviously)
- Textile content
- Collections
- Permalinks (for now)
- Layout inheritance (is this a deal-breaker?)
- Pagination (for now)
- Data Files in JSON, CSV, TSV
- subfolders for Data Files
- Drafts
- Importers
- Serving site locally
- watching and auto-regeneration
- _config.toml file type
- many Global and Site variables

## Testing

I used the [Good Clean Read](https://github.com/adueck/good-clean-read) theme to start testing as it's file structure is small and easy to understand.
